    "## Build an RPG Character\n",
    "### In this lab you will practice the basics of Python by building a small app that creates a character for an RPG adventure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **User Stories:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should have a function named ```create_character```.\n",
    "2. The function should accept, in order, a character name followed by three stats: strength, intelligence, and charisma.\n",
    "3. The character name should be validated:\n",
    "    - If the character name is not a string, the function should return ```The character name should be a string```.\n",
    "    - If the character name is an empty string, the function should return ```The character should have a name```.\n",
    "    - If the character name is longer than 10 characters, the function should return ```The character name is too long```.\n",
    "    - If the character name contains spaces, the function should return ```The character name should not contain spaces```.\n",
    "4. The stats should also be validated:\n",
    "    - If one or more stats are not integers, the function should return``` All stats should be integers```.\n",
    "    - If one or more stats are less than 1, the function should return ```All stats should be no less than 1```.\n",
    "    - If one or more stats are more than 4, the function should return ```All stats should be no more than 4```.\n",
    "    - If the sum of all stats is different than 7, the function should return ```The character should start with 7 points```.\n",
    "5. If all values pass the verification, the function should return a string with four lines:\n",
    "    - the first line should contain the character name\n",
    "    -  lines 2-4 should start with the stat abbreviation, ```STR```, ```INT``` or CHA (in this order), then a space, and then a number of full dots ```(●)``` equal to the value of the stat, and a number of empty dots ```(○) ```to reach 10. Example: if the value of strength is 3 there must be 3 full dots followed by 7 empty dots. The dots are given in the editor.\n",
    "Here's the string that should be returned by``` create_character('ren', 4, 2, 1):```"
